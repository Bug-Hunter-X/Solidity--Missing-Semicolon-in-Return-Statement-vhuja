This repository demonstrates a common but easily missed error in Solidity: a missing semicolon in a return statement.  The `bug.sol` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.sol` provides the corrected version.  The error, though seemingly minor, can lead to compilation failures or unexpected runtime behavior.
